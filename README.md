# OrangeHRM UI Login Page Automation Testing

This project demonstrates automated UI testing of the OrangeHRM login page using modern tools and best practices.

## Tools

- Python
- Playwright
- Pytest
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Description

This project uses the **Playwright** Python library to automate end-to-end testing of the OrangeHRM login page.  
Tests are triggered automatically on every push to the main branch using **GitHub Actions**, ensuring continuous validation.

Key features:
- Parametrized test cases using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
- Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
- Full test coverage using a **Decision Table** approach
- Automatic HTML report generation
- CI/CD integration with artifact upload

## Report

A **Decision Table** was used to design test cases covering all combinations of:
- Blank inputs
- Invalid credentials
- Valid credentials
- Case sensitivity

During testing, a bug was identified:  
üîê **Username field is not case-sensitive** ‚Äî both `Admin` and `admin` allow login with the correct password.

> ‚úÖ This behavior may be intentional for usability, but should be documented and verified with product requirements.
